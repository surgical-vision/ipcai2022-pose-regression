# IPCAI/IJCARS 2022 - Suppementary Material

This repository contains the Supplementary Material for the paper **Deep Learning-based Plane Pose Regression in Obstetric Ultrasound** by Di Vece C. et al. submitted for publication in the ''IPCAI 2022 Special Issue'' of the *International Journal for Computer-Assisted Radiology and Surgery (IJCARS)* and accepted for presentation at the *13th International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions (IPCAI 2022)* held in Tokyo, Japan.

## Available folders

- **model**: this folder contains the code of the network (`model.py`) and the final weigths for phantom (`phantom_weights.pt`) and real data (`real_weights.pt`);
- **standard-planes**: this folder containd the 2D slices of the annotated transventricular standard plane and the relative annotation for phantom data.
- **videos**: this folder contains three videos. *1.1_RP.mp4* and *1.1_SP.mp4* show the outcome of the prediction of the plane pose within the volume for Experiment 1.1, whereas *slice_acquisition.mp4* shows the sampling procedure for synthetic image acquisition;
- **volumes**: this folder contains the six 3D ultrasound phantom volumes.
